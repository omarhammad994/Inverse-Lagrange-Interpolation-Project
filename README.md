# Inverse-Lagrange-Interpolation-Project
MATLAB implementation of a Lagrange interpolation–based root-finding method. The project detects sign changes in the input dataset, selects the local points around the zero-crossing, and applies interpolation to obtain a more accurate root estimate. Includes the MATLAB function, test data, and a short report explaining the approach and results.
